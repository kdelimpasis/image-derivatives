## 1. Generating convolution kernels to calculate Signal and Image Derivatives
This source code implements the theorems for generating the finite impulse response (FIR) filters for signal derivatives of odd and even order. These filters are essentially symmetric finite differences, therefore we will use the terms, central, centered of FIR interchangeably. A very fast numerical implementation of central derivatives is also presented
### Example 1
Calculate the kernel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K"> with length <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2n%2B1"> 
for the order <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ord"> derivative

> K=descrete_deriv(ord,n)

Kernel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K"> is calculated as

> 0.0111,  -0.1500,  1.5000,  -2.7222,  1.5000,  -0.1500,  0.0111

### Example 2
Given an image <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I">, calculate the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_{xy}=\frac{\partial^2 I}{\partial x\partial y}"> using a kernel with size 9Ã—9 

We set the following
> n=4;

> ord1=1;

> ord2=1;


Then the following function is called

> [I,kc]=image_der1(I,ord1, ord2, n1,n2)
The original cameraman image, the 1st order derivative along x and y axis and the 9x9 corresponding kernel are shown below.

## Calculating image derivatives using IIR filtering - Compact derivatives
Signal and image derivatives can also be calculated using compact derivatives. This is a sophisticated method that involves both FIR filtering (centered differences) as well as solving a tridiagonal or pentadiagonal system of linear equations. In our work, the later part has been formulaed as a cascade of causal and anticausal filter. For more details, see our [IFIP 2013 paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-41142-7_33.pdf).

Any combination of 1st and 2nd order derivatives of any image <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I"> I is supported by the provided source code <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_{xy}, I_x, I_y, I_{xx}, I_{yy}, I_{xxy}, I_{xyy}, I_{xxyy}">. 
> [Ix,Iy,Ixy,Ixx,Iyy,Ixyy,Ixxy,Ixxyy]=image_der_IIR(I,n1,n2);

n1 is the accuracy of the 1st derivative, with possible values 6, 8 and 10

n2 is the accuracy of the 2nd derivative, with possible values 4, 6, 8 and 10


The spectral response of exemplar derivative operators (both centered and compact) for the 1st order derivative are shown below.
