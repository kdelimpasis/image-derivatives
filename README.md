## 1. Generating convolution kernels to calculate Signal and Image Derivatives
This source code implements the theorems for generating the finite impulse response (FIR) filters for signal derivatives of odd and even order. These filters are essentially symmetric finite differences, therefore we will use the terms, central, centered of FIR interchangeably. A very fast numerical implementation of central derivatives is also presented
### Example 1
Calculate the kernel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K"> with length <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2n%2B1"> 
for the order <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ord"> derivative

> K=descrete_deriv(ord,n)

Kernel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K"> is calculated as

> 0.0111,  -0.1500,  1.5000,  -2.7222,  1.5000,  -0.1500,  0.0111

### Example 2
Given an image <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I">, calculate the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_{xy}=\frac{\partial^2 I}{\partial x\partial y}"> using a kernel with size 9Ã—9 

We set the following
> n=4;

> ord1=1;

> ord2=1;


Then the following function is called

> [I,kc]=image_der1(I,ord1, ord2, n1,n2)

## Calculating image derivatives using IIR filtering - Compact derivatives
Signal and image derivatives ca nalso be calculated using compact derivatives. This is a sophisticated method that involves both FIR filetring (centered differences) as well as solving a tridiagonal or pentadiagonal system of linear equations. In our work, the later part has been formulaed as a cascade of causal and anticausal filter. For more details, see our [IFIP 2013 paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-41142-7_33.pdf).

Any combination of 1st and 2nd order derivatives of any image I is supported by the provided source code. 
> [Ix,Iy,Ixy,Ixx,Iyy,Ixyy,Ixxy,Ixxyy]=image_der_IIR(I,n1,n2);
> n1 is the accuracy of the 1st derivative, with possible values 6, 8 and 10
> n2 is the accuracy of the 2nd derivative, with possible values 4, 6, 8 and 10


StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**


## Export a file

You can export the current file by clicking **Export to disk** in the menu. You can choose to export the file as plain Markdown, as HTML using a Handlebars template or as a PDF.


# Synchronization

Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your **Google Drive**, your **Dropbox** and your **GitHub** accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow... The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.

There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:

- The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.
	> To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.

- The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub**.
	> Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the **Synchronize** sub-menu.

## Open a file

You can open a file from **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Open from**. Once opened in the workspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.

## Save a file

You can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on**. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.

## Synchronize a file

Once your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.

If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the **Synchronize now** button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The **Synchronize now** button is disabled if you have no file to synchronize.

## Manage file synchronization

Since one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking **File synchronization** in the **Synchronize** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized locations that are linked to your file.


# Publication

Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you're happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting platforms like **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **WordPress** and **Zendesk**. With [Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/), you have full control over what you export.

> Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the **Publish** sub-menu.

## Publish a File

You can publish your file by opening the **Publish** sub-menu and by clicking **Publish to**. For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:

- Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),
- HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).

## Update a publication

After publishing, StackEdit keeps your file linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to re-publish it. Once you have modified your file and you want to update your publication, click on the **Publish now** button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The **Publish now** button is disabled if your file has not been published yet.

## Manage file publication

Since one file can be published to multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking **File publication** in the **Publish** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove publication locations that are linked to your file.

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.
